## Norms the data within specified groups in a data frame; it normalizes each
## subject (identified by idvar) so that they have the same mean, within each group
## specified by betweenvars.
##   data: a data frame.
##   idvar: the name of a column that identifies each subject (or matched subjects)
##   measurevar: the name of a column that contains the variable to be summariezed
##   betweenvars: a vector containing names of columns that are between-subjects variables
##   na.rm: a boolean that indicates whether to ignore NA's
